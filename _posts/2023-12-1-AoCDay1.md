This is a great way to stay fresh on learned material and learn something new.

* Learn how to defend against prompt injection attacks.

## Writeup

These outcomes are a result of the training used. Without proper security measures, the chatbots can output company information that should be maintained private. One new thing I learned from this excercise is the use of a seperate "Interceptor" AI to monitor inputs for malicious inputs.
