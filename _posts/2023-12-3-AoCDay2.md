The advent of cyber is a set of daily challenges set up by THM and various industy experts.
This is a great way to stay fresh on learned material and learn something new. The second day is focused on Log analysis, data, and python. 

## Learning Objectives

* Get an introduction to what data science involves and how it can be applied in Cybersecurity
* Get a gentle (We promise) introduction to Python
* Get to work with some popular Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to crunch data
* Help McHoneyBell establish an understanding of AntarctiCraftsâ€™ network


## Writeup

 Today's challenge goes into using Pandas and Matplotlib to conduct data analysis. Pandas allows you to format the data, making it into tables in which rows and columns can be categorized. Matplotlib can be used to illustrate the data by creating a graph.
