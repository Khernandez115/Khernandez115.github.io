#### Hello, I'm Kenneth. Welcome to my page!

I am a current student in Georgia Institute of Technology's online program pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity.

I attended Loyola University of Chicago where I earned my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and found my passion for the field.

This passion for Cybersecurity stems from its ability to combine my interest in technology and helping others.

This page is a place that allows me to share my findings as I continue to expand on that passion.
